## Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts

The protocol does not use an oracle for collateral factor calculation. Instead, it utilizes a `xyz=k` constant product algorithm to discover both interest rate and collateral factor. x and y determines interest rate, while x and z determines collateral factor. Whenever the ratio of x, y, and z are not up to market rate, then it means it is a favorable price for a lender or borrower.

## Does the token conform to the ERC-20 standard? In what specific ways does it differ?

The Bond ERC20, Insurance ERC20, Liquidity ERC20, and Collateralized Debt ERC721 in the Convenience repo follows the token standard. The key difference they have is that they donâ€™t store total supply in the contract, instead the respective claims (bond and insurance), dues, and liquidity balanceOf of those ERC20 and ERC721 contracts are the total supply.
